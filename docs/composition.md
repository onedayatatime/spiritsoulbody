# Parts of human being

What are we made of?

## Spirit, Soul and Body
**1 Thessalonians 5:23**
> May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

**Hebrews 4:12**
> For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.

**Inferences**

* We are made of 3 distinct parts - Spirit, Soul and Body
* All three parts must be sanctified and kept blameless
* Soul and Spirit seem to be intertwined (or difficult to distinguish) but the Word of God is sharp enough to separate them

## Creation of Man
**Genesis 2:7** <a href="http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-7.htm" target="_blank">interlinear</a>
> Then the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being .

**John 6:63**
> The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you--they are full of the Spirit and life.

**Job 33:4** <a href="http://biblehub.com/interlinear/job/33-4.htm" target="_blank">interlinear</a>
> The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.

**Inferences**

* When God breathed into man's nostrils, soul (living being) was formed/produced.
* Soul seems to be the result of union of the spirit and body.

## Illustrations

* A light bulb when connected to a power source yields light. Bulb with wiring - body. Power/electricity - spirit. Light - Soul.
* A drop of ink when mixed with a cup of water gives ink-water. The result has become a third component though it can be called as ink/water.

## Holy Spirit vs human spirit
**Romans 8: 16**
> The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.

**Inferences**

* Spirit of man is different from the Holy Spirit



## Yet to figure out
* Is 'breath of life' the spirit of man? Or did the breath created the spirit of man?
* Is the spirit of man eternal?
* Is the soul formed at the amalgamation of spirit and body? Does it mean it'll cease to exist when the spirit leaves the body?
* Where does the spirit go when a person dies?
* Where does the soul go when someone dies?
* Biblical references for Nee's statement : Joints and Marrows = Mind and Will
* How and when does spirit and soul get formed today?
* What happened when Adam & Eve sinned?

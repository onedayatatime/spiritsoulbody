What are we made of?

## Spirit, Soul and Body

> May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. - **1 Thessalonians 5:23**

> For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. - **Hebrews 4:12**

**Inferences**

* We are made of 3 distinct parts - Spirit, Soul and Body
* All three parts must be sanctified and kept blameless
* Soul and Spirit seem to be intertwined (or difficult to distinguish) but the Word of God is sharp enough to separate them
* According to God's design the hierarchy is Spirit, Soul and Body as seen in the word order. 



## Temple of God

> Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in your  midst? - **1 Corinthians 3:16**

**Inferences**

* Temple (in old testament) was divided into 3 parts
	1. Outer court - which everyone can see and go in
	2. Holy Place - Only priests enter here. They're still outside the veil
	3. Holy of holies - A place devoid of worldly light where High priest is allowed once a year
* If Man is a temple of God, then there must be 3 parts
	1. Body - seen by all
	2. Soul - feelings, will, intellect (mind)
	3. Spirit - a place unknowable with worldy light (illumination). It only could be reached if the veil is removed


## Illustrations

* A light bulb when connected to a power source yields light. 
	* Bulb with wiring - body
	* Power/electricity - spirit
	* Light - Soul
* Another rough example - A drop of ink when mixed with a cup of water gives ink-water. The result has become a third component though it can be called as ink/water.

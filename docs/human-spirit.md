### Functions of human spirit

* Man's spirit is composed of 3 parts/functions
	* Conscience
	* Intuition
	* Fellowship with God

Discernment of right and wrong is not influenced by the knowledge in mind. It is rather spontaneous. Conscience could condemn even things that one's reasoning condones. This knowledge comes directly from intuition which is consciousness within man's spirit. Intuition inturn is linked to fellowship and worship.

### Yet to figure out
* Is 'breath of life' the spirit of man? Or did the breath created the spirit of man?
* Is the spirit of man eternal?
* Is the soul formed at the amalgamation of spirit and body? Does it mean it'll cease to exist when the spirit leaves the body?
* Where does the spirit go when a person dies?
* Where does the soul go when someone dies?
* Biblical references for Nee's statement : Joints and Marrows = Mind and Will
* How and when does spirit and soul get formed today?
* What happened when Adam & Eve sinned?



## Yet to validate
* Soul is the seat of personality; man's will, intellect, and emotion
* Duty of the soul is to maintain the superiority of the spirit but it has been given 'free will' to choose what it wants - to obey the spirit or rebel joining hands with the body
* Before man fell, spirit controlled the being by communicating with the soul and the soul activated the body to follow the order of the spirit as spirit cannot directly control the body.

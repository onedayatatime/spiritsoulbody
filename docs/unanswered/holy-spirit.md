#### When Jesus was on earth, did He have both His own spirit and Holy Spirit? Or was His own Spirit none other than the Holy Spirit? If latter, why did the Spirit descend like a dove?

#### Whose spirit did Jesus give up when he died?
> And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit. - **Matthew 27:50**

#### Why blasphemy against the Spirit is not forgiven?
> ... but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. - **Matthew 12:31**

> ... but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. - **Matthew 12:32**

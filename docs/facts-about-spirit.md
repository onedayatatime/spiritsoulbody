## Functions of Spirit

**1 Corinthians 2:11**
> For who knows a person's thoughts except their own spirit within them? 

**Inferences**

* Man's spirit knows his thoughts

## Holy Spirit vs human spirit
**Romans 8: 16**
> The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.

**Inferences**

* Spirit of man is different from the Holy Spirit

## Yet to figure out
* Is 'breath of life' the spirit of man? Or did the breath created the spirit of man?
* Is the spirit of man eternal?
* Is the soul formed at the amalgamation of spirit and body? Does it mean it'll cease to exist when the spirit leaves the body?
* Where does the spirit go when a person dies?
* Where does the soul go when someone dies?
* Biblical references for Nee's statement : Joints and Marrows = Mind and Will
* How and when does spirit and soul get formed today?
* What happened when Adam & Eve sinned?



## Yet to validate

* Soul is the seat of personality; man's will, intellect, and emotion
* Duty of the soul is to maintain the superiority of the spirit but it has been given 'free will' to choose what it wants - to obey the spirit or rebel joining hands with the body
* Before man fell, spirit controlled the being by communicating with the soul and the soul activated the body to follow the order of the spirit as spirit cannot directly control the body.

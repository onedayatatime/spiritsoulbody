# Introduction

This site is a collection of notes which began as an attempt to understand myself. I was searching through scriptures for answers to the fundamental questions - Who am I? Where did I come from? And where am I going? 

I'm sharing it here in the hope that it might benefit someone. If you have any corrections/inputs/questions, please feel free to write to [me](mailto:walktoeternity@gmail.com)

This site is a work in progress.

## My beliefs

* `Trinity` - I believe in one God existing in distinct 3 forms - Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
* `Word of God` - I believe scripture is given by divine inspiration and only Holy Spirit can help in unraveling the encoded wisdom

## References

* `Spirit, Soul and Body` - A book by Andrew Wommack
* `Spiritual Man` - A book series by Watchman Nee
